Sarah was enjoying a truly wonderful day until she fell victim to the world's greatest injustice- a strange man ran by and snatched the doener right out of her hand before she could even take a bite!
Upset and hungry, Sarah chased the stranger down the Haupstrasse, running faster than a Porsche GT3RS.
She hunted him down like a Hund all the way to the Flughafen, growing numb to the hunger and rage. 
She saw a plane take off from the Flughafen Berlin and thought she'd lost him, when she saw a man holding her doener speed away in a car.
Sarah commandeered a BMW M8 Competition Coupe to pursue the stranger, flipping on the radio to Rammstein â€” the perfect soundtrack for a car chase.
Her dirndl flapping in the wind, she gained ground on the thief until he took a desperate turn at too high a speed that sent him skidding straight into a biergarten!
